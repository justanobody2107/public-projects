# Public Projects by JustANobody2107
Totally not a ~~useless~~ repo with good things maybe. Neko's all the way.

## What's here?

 - [Nekofetch](https://github.com/justanobody2107/public-projects/tree/main/nekofetch) is a great powershell script that will show your system info, along with a picture of a catgirl. This requires winfetch, but is installable through [my scoop bucket](https://github.com/justanobody2107/scoop-bucket).
 - [NekoDL](https://github.com/justanobody2107/public-projects/tree/main/nekodl) is a great python script that will download a user-specified amount of catgirls to your disk, wherever you want them to go. This has no requirements apart from Python3 (and if you're on windows a copy of python.exe renamed as python3.exe in the same directory).
